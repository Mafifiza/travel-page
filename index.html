            <h2>Why Cape Town?</h2>
            <h3>Cape Town, the Mother City</h3>
            <p>
              Cape Town is the legislative capital of South Africa. It is the
              country's oldest city and the seat of the Parliament of South
              Africa. Cape Town is the country's second-largest city by
              population, after Johannesburg, and the largest city in the
              Western Cape. The city is part of the City of Cape Town
              metropolitan municipality. It is known for its harbour, its
              natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks
              such as Table Mountain and Cape Point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cape Town has been named the best city in the world, and world's
              best city for travelers, numerous times, including by The New York
              Times in 2014, Time Out in 2025, and The Telegraph for the past 8
              years (2017 through 2025). Located on the shore of Table Bay, the
              City Bowl area of Cape Town, which contains its central business
              district (CBD), is the oldest urban area in the Western Cape, with
              a significant cultural heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The metropolitan area has a long coastline on the Atlantic Ocean,
              which includes a northern section in the West Beach region, as
              well as the False Bay area in the south. The Table Mountain
              National Park is within the city boundaries and there are several
              other nature reserves and marine-protected areas within and
              adjacent to the city, protecting the diverse terrestrial and
              marine natural environment. These include Kirstenbosch National
              Botanical Garden.
